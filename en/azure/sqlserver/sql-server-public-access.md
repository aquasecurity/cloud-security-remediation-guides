## Quick Info

| | |
|-|-|
| **Plugin Title** | SQL Server Public Access |
| **Cloud** | AZURE |
| **Category** | SQL Server |
| **Description** | Ensures that SQL Servers do not allow public access |
| **More Info** | Unless there is a specific business requirement, SQL Server instances should not have a public endpoint and should only be accessed from within a VNET. |
| **AZURE Link** | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-security-overview/ |
| **Recommended Action** | Ensure that the firewall of each SQL Server is configured to prohibit traffic from the public 0.0.0.0 global IP address. |

6. To disable public access, uncheck "Allow Azure services and resources to access this server" and click "save" button.</br> <img src="/resources/azure/sqlserver/sql-server-public-access/step6.png"/>
7. Under "Firewall Rules" if you see an entry for IP address "0.0.0.0" then traffic from global public IPs is allowed. </br> <img src="/resources/azure/sqlserver/sql-server-public-access/step7.png"/>
8. To disable traffic from global public IPs, remove the firewall rule with IP address "0.0.0.0". To delete it, click on the triple dot (...) at the end and select "Delete" from the dropdown menu.</br> <img src="/resources/azure/sqlserver/sql-server-public-access/step8.png"/>
9. Click on the "Save" button to make the changes.</br> <img src="/resources/azure/sqlserver/sql-server-public-access/step9.png"/>
10. Repeat steps number 3 - 9 to ensure that the firewall of each SQL Server is configured to prohibit traffic from the public 0.0.0.0 global IP address.</br>
