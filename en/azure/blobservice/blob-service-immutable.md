| **Description** | Ensures data immutability is properly configured for blob services to protect critical data against deletion |
| **More Info** | Immutable storage helps store data securely by protecting critical data against deletion. |
| **AZURE Link** | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-immutable-storage#Getting-started |
| **Recommended Action** | Enable a data immutability policy for all storage containers in the Azure storage account. |

## Detailed Remediation Steps

1. Log in to the Microsoft Azure Management Console.
2. Find the search bar at the top and search for "Storage accounts". </br> <img src="/resources/azure/blobservice/blob-service-immutable/step2.png"/>

6. In the selected "Blob", click on the "Access Policy" and check the "Permissions" assosciated with the "Blob". If the "Blob" allow full read,add,create,write, delete, or list permissions then the selected "Blob" is not properly configured in blob services to protect critical data against deletion.</br> <img src="/resources/azure/blobservice/blob-service-immutable/step6.png"/>
7. Repeat steps number 2 - 6 to verify other "Blobs" in the Storage accounts. </br>
8. Navigate to the "Storage accounts", select the "Storage account" and click on the "Name", select the "Overview" options and select the "Blob" by clicking on the "Name" as a link to access the configurations.</br> <img src="/resources/azure/blobservice/blob-service-immutable/step8.png"/>
