## Quick Info

| **Description** | Ensures encryption is properly configured for Blob Services |
| **More Info** | Blob Services can be configured to encrypt data-at-rest. By default Azure will create a set of keys to encrypt Blob Services, but the recommended approach is to create your own keys using Azure Key Vault. |

| **Recommended Action** | Ensure that Blob Service is configured to use a customer-provided key vault key. |
