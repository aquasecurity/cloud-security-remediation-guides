4. Review each userâ€™s Access Advisor tab to check for recent activity and determine if the user account is actively in use.
5. For actively used accounts, consider disabling or deleting the IAM user account to prevent non-role-based management.
6. If deletion is needed, select the user, click Delete user, and confirm the action. Repeat for other actively used IAM accounts.
