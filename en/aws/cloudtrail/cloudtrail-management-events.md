   b. In the Management events section, under API activity, choose if you want your trail or event data store to log Read events, Write events, or both. <br />
   **Read:**<br />
   Read-only events include API operations that read your resources, but don't make changes. For example, read-only events include the Amazon EC2 DescribeSecurityGroups and DescribeSubnets API operations. These operations return only information about your Amazon EC2 resources and don't change your configurations.
   **Write:**<br />
   Write to record write-only events (i.e. API operations that change or might change your AWS resources, such as RunInstances and TerminateInstances API operations). Choose both Read and Write if you want your CloudTrail trail to log all API operations.
