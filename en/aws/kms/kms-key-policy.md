| **Cloud** | AWS |
| **Category** | KMS |
| **Description** | Validates the KMS key policy to ensure least-privilege access. |
| **More Info** | KMS key policies should be designed to limit the number of users who can perform encrypt and decrypt operations. Each application should use its own key to avoid over exposure. |
