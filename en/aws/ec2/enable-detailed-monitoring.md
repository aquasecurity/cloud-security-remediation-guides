| **Description**        | Ensure that EC2 instances have detailed monitoring feature enabled.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **More Info**          | By default, your instance is enabled for basic monitoring. You can optionally enable detailed monitoring. After you enable detailed monitoring, the Amazon EC2 console displays monitoring graphs with a 1-minute period for the instance. |
