# AWS / EC2 / Open SMBoTCP

## Quick Info

| | |
|-|-|
| **Plugin Title** | Open SMBoTCP |
| **Cloud** | AWS |
| **Category** | EC2 |
| **Description** | Determine if TCP port 445 for Windows SMB over TCP is open to the public |
| **More Info** | While some ports such as HTTP and HTTPS are required to be open to the public to function properly, more sensitive services such as SMB should be restricted to known IP addresses. |
| **AWS Link** | http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/authorizing-access-to-an-instance.html |
| **Recommended Action** | Restrict TCP port 445 to known IP addresses |

3. Scroll down the left navigation panel and choose "Security Group" under "Network & Security".</br> <img src="/resources/aws/ec2/open-smbotcp/step3.png"/>
4. Select the "EC2 Security Group" that needs to be verified. </br> <img src="/resources/aws/ec2/open-smbotcp/step4.png"/>
5. Scroll down the bottom panel and choose "Inbound rules". Verify the value for "Source" column for "SMB" under "Type" for port "445" for "Windows SMB" and if any rule have value set to "0.0.0.0/0" or "::/0 " then the selected "Security Group" has "TCP" port for "SMBoTCP" open to the public.</br> <img src="/resources/aws/ec2/open-smbotcp/step5.png"/>
6. Repeat step number 2 - 5 to verify other "Security Groups" in the selected AWS region.</br> 
7. Navigate to "Security Groups" under "Network & Security" and select the "Security Group" that needs to modify to restrict the access of "TCP" port 445 for "Windows SMB" over TCP  to specific ip address. </br> <img src="/resources/aws/ec2/open-smbotcp/step7.png"/>
8. Scroll down the page and select the "Inbound rules" and click on the "Edit Inbound rules" button to the right. </br> <img src="/resources/aws/ec2/open-smbotcp/step8.png"/>
9. In the "Edit inbound rules" tab select either the "MyIP" or "Custom" from the "Source" column.</br> <img src="/resources/aws/ec2/open-smbotcp/step9.png"/>
10. In the "Edit inbound rules" tab select the "MyIP" from the "Source" column to allow "Windows SMB" over TCP inbound traffic only from your IP address.</br> <img src="/resources/aws/ec2/open-smbotcp/step10.png"/>
11. In the "Edit inbound rules" tab select the "Custom" from the "Source" column as per the requirements for "SMBoTCP" and specify static IP/Elastic IP address along with "Description" for the "Security Group" rule. </br> <img src="/resources/aws/ec2/open-smbotcp/step11.png"/>
12. Click on the "Save rules" button to make the necessary changes. </br> <img src="/resources/aws/ec2/open-smbotcp/step12.png"/>
13. Repeat step number 7 - 12 to restrict TCP port 445 for "Windows SMB" over TCP to known IP address.
